<div class="blue">
**What this course is:**

- An introduction to the `ggplot2` library and the various chart types and aesthetics

- An introduction to R Markdown and reproducible reports

</div>

**What this course is not:**

- a deep dive into data analysis or exploratory data analysis

- a course on statistics, modeling or prediction

- a comprehensive on all tidyverse functions and packages



#Data Visualization

- Communicate complex information, spot patterns and to tell a story

- Core component of Explortatory Data Analysis

- Step taken before modelling or interpreting data

- Highlight useful information and trends

- Charts, graphs, infographics and maps

- Human are perceptive at viewing and processing visual information for large amounts of data 

- Text and tables can be overwhelming and patterns are undetected


#Data Visualization Principles

<div class="blue">
<center>
What question need to be answered?

Who is your intended audience ?

What are you trying to show ?

How can a visualization show this or make relationships more clear?

</center>
</div>

# Bad Visualizations


- Too much information : many labels, too much colour, too much to interpret, many figures/data/labels on one plot

- Confusing 

    - at first glance you cannot interpret the figure without help

- What is the point?

- Misleading

    - cutting off data values
      
    - bad scale or adjusted scales
    
    - hiding or removing outliers when they may be important to the anaylsis

#Data Visualization Principles

```{r goodchild, out.width="50%",out.extra='style="float:left; padding:5px"'}

knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/goochild_rhind_2015.png')

```




**Size**: The size of points are varied based on the values or ratios from the data. 

**Value/Contrast** – how light or dark a particular colour is while hue is held constant

**Hue** is the use of color – used to distinguish between classes or categories (agricultural land vs urban land use)
Hues can be combined with different textures or shapes if there are a large number of categories.  Typically when printing images that are in black and white.

**Saturation** – a mixture of grey and a hue, the intensity of color.  

Hue, Contrast, Saturation and Colour are important to understand in terms of accessibility and colourblindness.

#Shape

Shape can be used to divide up categories, draw attention to a particular data point or shape.

In ggplot2 we have the option of these shapes:

<div class= "left" style="float:left; width:50%">
```{r ggshapes}

df_lines <- data.frame(
  linetype = factor(
    1:4,
    labels = c("solid", "longdash", "dashed", "dotted")
  )
)
ggplot(df_lines) +
  geom_hline(aes(linetype = linetype, yintercept = 0), size = 2) +
  scale_linetype_identity() +
  facet_grid(linetype ~ .) +
  theme_void(20)

```

</div>

<div class= "right" style="float:right; width:50%">
```{r shapes}

df_shapes <- data.frame(shape = 0:24)
ggplot(df_shapes, aes(0, 0, shape = shape)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = shape), size = 5, fill = 'blue') +
  scale_shape_identity() +
  facet_wrap(~shape) +
  theme_void()

```
</div>



#Contrast

```{r nytimes, out.width="100%", out.height="100%",fig.cap="The New York Times"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Figures/contrast_nytimes.png")



```

##Colour

- A great resource for choosing colour schemes that are colourblind friendly and aesthetically pleasing is ColorBrewer 2.0 http://colorbrewer2.org/
- Two libraries in R `viridis` and `RColorbrewer`

<div style="width:100%">
<div class="left" style="float:left; width:40%">

*Sequential* : Great for low to high values go from light colours to darker 

*Diverging*: highlight differences e.g. standard deviation 


*Qualitative*: Used to present categorical data, soil types, type of neighbourhood
</div>

<div class= "right" style="float:right; width:60%">

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/sequential.png')

knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/diverging.png')

knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/qualitative.png')
# include_graphics('./Figures/Session2_geoms_2.png')

#Colour Blindness

<div style="width:100%">
<div class="left" style="float:left; width:50%">
```{r cb, out.width="75%"}

knitr::include_graphics("./Figures/colour_scale.png")

```
</div>
<div class= "right" style="float:right; width:50%">

```{r cb2, out.width="75%"}

knitr::include_graphics("./Figures/cb2.png")

```
</div>
</div>

#Colour

Colour with no purpose takes away from the meaning of the data, aka rainbow effects

```{r, rainbow, out.width="50%",out.extra='style="float:left; padding:0px"'}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = fct_rev(fct_infreq(manufacturer)),fill=manufacturer))+ 
    labs(x="manufacturer")+
  coord_flip()



```

```{r, norainbow, out.width="50%",out.extra='style="float:right; padding:0px"'}
ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = fct_rev(fct_infreq(manufacturer))),fill="lightblue") + 
    labs(x="manufacturer")+
  coord_flip()


```


#Choosing a visualization

<div style="width:100%">
<div class="left" style="float:left; width:40%">
With all the plotting libraries available in R - how do you choose?

There are some great flowcharts and websites to make the decision easier when stuck:

- <a href="https://datavizcatalogue.com"> Data Viz Catalogue</a>

- <a href="https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/"> R Graph Gallery</a>

- More on this on Thursday...
</div>
<div class= "right" style="float:right; width:60%">
```{r dataviz,out.width="75%",out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}

knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/data_viz.png')


```

</div>
</div>

#Tidyverse

A collection of R packages that make it easier to work with data. 

```{r tidyverse,out.width= "35%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/tidy_verse.png')

```

- `dplyr` is used to manipulate, group, and summarize data

- `ggplot2` is a data visualization library that we will be using in the course!

- `readr` loads data into R

- `tibble` data format, similar to data frames

- `purrr` functions which replace for loops with code that is both more succinct and easier to read

- `tidyr` is a library meant for formatting and shaping data into the 'tidy' format...

#Tidy Data

It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the cleaning and preparing data. The goal of tidyr is to help you create tidy data. Tidy data is data where:

<div style="width:100%">
<div class="left" style="float:left; width:40%">
  - Every column is variable.
  - Every row is an observation..
  - Every cell is a single value.
</div>

<div class= "right" style="float:right; width:60%">

```{r tidy,echo=FALSE,out.width="90%",out.extra=""}
knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/tidy-1.png')


```

</div>
</div>

"data tidying: structuring datasets to facilitate analysis."

Tidy data describes a standard way of storing data that is used wherever possible throughout the tidyverse. It is an attempt to standardize data.

All `tidyverse` packages are designed to work with tidy data.




#Setting up your environment and projects

<div class="blue">
R uses a "working directory" which is where R will first look for files that you want it to load and where it will save.
A recommended structure for R projects is as follows:

-  Set up a directory for the project/analysis. Inside this folder create a "Workspace". 
- Inside your workspace create two folders, Data and Outputs. Data for where you will be loading raw data from and outputs for saving.

A great tool in R is to "Create a New Project", which will then be mapped to your "Workspace".
This is similar to use `setwd()` in R, however all projects by default are mapped to the folder it is saved in. 

- All references can be relative`"./Data/"` rather than absolute paths `"C:/Desktop/Projects/ABC/Data/"`

</div>

#R Markdown

- *markdown* is a simplified language for text output that is commonly used to convert text to the HTML language that is meant to be easily understood.

- R Markdown is an authoring format that combines the *markdown* syntax with embedded R code chunks

- allows you to combine your notes, narrative, methods, code and results in one file

- fully reproducible with many output formats: PDF, word, html, dashboards and slideshows

- can use multiple programming languages in one document such as: R, Python, and SQL

https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/


# R Markdown

Designed to be used in three ways:

1. Communication to decision makers

    - high level conclusions and visualizations

2. Collaboration with teams 

    - Including code, methods and approach

3. Environment to **do** data analysis 

    - A modern day lab notebook including what you did, your code, and why you did it that way



# R Markdown

All R markdown documents end in **.rmd** as opposed to **.R**. The start of a markdown file is called a "YAML". Here you can specify the title and other meta data attributes to your file, as well as the outputs generated. Such as a pdf, word file, or html document

Each "chunk" represented by ``` of R code can executed independently and visualizations are generated in-line.

```{r default,echo=FALSE,out.width="90%",out.extra=""}
knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/markdown.png')


```


#Chunk Options

`eval = FALSE` prevents code from being evaluated. This is useful for displaying example code, or for disabling a large block of code without commenting each line.

`include = FALSE` runs the code, but doesn’t show the code or results in the final document. 

`echo = FALSE` prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. Use this when writing reports aimed at people who don’t want to see the underlying R code. Or to show a figure generated by `ggplot2`

```{r markdown output,out.width="90%",out.extra=""}

knitr::include_graphics("./Figures/default_markdown.png")

```

***

#Change Theme

```{r markdown output2,out.width= "25%", out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}

knitr::include_graphics("./Figures/darkly_yaml.png")

```

```{r darkly, out.width= "75%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:0px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("./Figures/darkly.png")
```

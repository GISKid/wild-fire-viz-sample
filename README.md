# wild-fire-viz-sample
Content for teaching ggplot2 using wild fire data from British Columbia.
The data we are using is [BC Historical Wildlfires](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/fire-incident-locations-historical) from the open data catalogue.
From their description:

>Wildfire historic incident point locations for all fire seasons before the current season. Supplied through various sources. Not to be used for legal purposes. This data includes all incidents tracked by BC Wildfire Service, ie. actual fires, suspected fires, nuisance fires, smoke chases, etc. On April 1 of each year this layer is updated with the previous fire season's data.

## Structure

This webinar had slides (not provided) and live coding done in R Markdown (.rmd files). [Session 3](https://www.mapdatascience.com/courses/ggplot-tidy/session3_exercise) and [Session 4](https://www.mapdatascience.com/courses/ggplot-tidy/session4_exercise) are also provided as .html files
The first two sessions are an introduction to using ggplot2 and rmarkdown. 
Sessions 3 and 4 are where we start making pretty visualizations with all ggplot2 has to offer.

### Session 1

- How to read in data
- Exploratory Analysis
- Introduction to quick ggplot2 (we aren't making it pretty yet!) 


### Session 2

- Using R Markdown 
- Introduction to dplyr
- Working with dates and lubridate 
- Bar charts, box plots, line graphs
- Using shapes, positions of bars, jitter, labels, legend positioning, label positions and rotation
- Colour palettes
- Themes

### Session 3
